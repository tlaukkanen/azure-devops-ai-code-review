## What does it cost?

The extension itself is free. The reviews will utilize your own Azure OpenAI services so it will depend on the model that you deploy. As of today October 2024 the GPT-4o-mini seems to be optimal for this purpose and is cheap to use - today price for input prompt was $0.15 per 1M tokens, output was $0.60 per 1M tokens. While completing many pull requests the price per code review ranges from ~$0.0002 to ~$0.002 per review - so if you have 1000 PRs per month it's a [price of coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/tlaukkanen) ðŸ˜‰

You can set the token pricing on the task parameters and then you can see from your logs how much each of the reviews cost:
